		<p>"Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people, you struggle to resist the urge to punch them in the face, and for what?! For some pimply little puke who treats you like dirt unless you're on a team!  Well I'm better than dirt! Well, most kinds of dirt.  Not that fancy store-bought dirt.  That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I-I can't compete with that stuff." -Moe Syzlack
